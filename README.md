### **Introduction:**
When I was a very little kid, my dad took me to the local bank to help me open my first ever bank account.  “But Dad…why would I want to put my money somewhere else?  Isn’t better if I just keep it? In MY OWN piggy bank?” “Well, the bank keeps it safe, if your house was broken into and a burglar stole your money, you wouldn’t be able to get it back.” 
Unfortunately for my father, I was a bit too smart for my own good.  I replied quickly, “But l can just lock it up in a safe! Right?”  

Much like the time I interrogated my parents over the existence of Santa Claus, I simply could not understand why I would want to relinquish control of my valuable assets to anyone. This concept defied all logic my 6- or 7-year-old brain could fathom.  
He was at a loss, but being beaten by a 7-year-old in a debate was not something he was going to fall victim to that day.   “Well the real reason you want to keep your money in the bank is that it grows.”

“Like it gets bigger??”  I spread my hands out imagining a huge dollar bill, my eyes widening with amazement.  

“No, like you earn more of it.”

Now the difference here was this was a time when your savings account at a bank still earned you a decent interest rate.  I’m not sure what the actual APY was then, but today standard American savings accounts earn pathetic .03% (Bank Of America) or an even more embarrassing .01% (JP MORGAN/CHASE) 
If my five-year old self tried to have the same argument with my father today, his defense might not hold water, if he would even be able to justify that same response.  This is one area that the crypto space is really disrupting the status quo.

### **Overview and Origin:**
Founded in 2017, by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez, BlockFi’s mission is to provide commercial credit services to markets that have limited access.  Blockfi is a disruptive online banking, lending and crypto asset investment platform.  It might sound a bit more complicated than it is, it is pretty simple.
There are millions of individuals on the planet that don’t have access to basic services like banking and even savings accounts. This is but one of the massive issues that Blockfi aims to solve, but at the current moment, it’s not showing any signs of backing down!

BlockFi sets itself apart in the crypto asset domain by pairing industry leading rates with institutional benefits.  Blockfi sets itself apart in the banking industry by proving access to other assets than traditional, government controlled and inflated FIAT currency, as well as providing other services like credit cards and even lending.  BlockFi essentially covers multiple domains;  personal finance/online banking, lending, as well as, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  

Not only does Blockfi serve the underserved and reach a global audience of millions of people previously left in the dark and denied traditional banking services.  BlockFi is actively and seamlessly serving the underserved American audience.  
With the wealth gap widening, inflation rampant and traditional banking services reduction of benefits and services offered to middle and working-class individuals, the average American is actually missing out on valuable financial benefits that were readily available to their parents just a few years ago.

Being the only independent lender with institutional backing from some impressive industry leaders such as Valar Ventures, Galaxy Digital, Fidelity, Akuna Capital, SoFi, and Coinbase Ventures, Blockfi is already blazing trails for a entire new way of online banking and accessing digital currencies.  

Gathering just 1.55 million in their seed round of investing in 2018, Blockfi is a baby in the banking sector, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t a threat to the current kings of the industry.  Their early-stage funding that same year received a whopping 52.5 million.  
As recent of March of this year (2021) still a private company; BlockfI was valuated at $3 billion, up from $435 million, when it raised 50 million in series C funding, just six months prior.  The New Jersey based lending firm has taken on 350 million in series D venture capital funding, one of the largest to date among blockchain and crypto currency start-ups. 
“This round of funding was led Bain Capital Ventures, partners of DST Global, Pop Investments, and Tiger Global.  The investment follows three prior rounds within the last 2 years, totaling more than 100 million, raised from venture capital firms including Galaxy Digital, Susquehanna & Winklevoss Capital’ -Forbes 2021

### **Research Depth:**

The average American deserves better.  In so many ways, but specifically in banking.  Prior to 1970, if you were upset with how the federal reserve was printing money, or how the government was behaving regarding international affairs, you could essentially ‘walk with your feet’ and protest with your money.  Yes.  If you were upset with the fed, you could go down to your bank and trade your cash for gold.  If the gold supply started to deplete in the vaults of financial institutions, the voices of the people, as result were essentially heard.  

Today that is no longer the case.  I mean, can you imagine if that had been possible in March of 2020?  We would have probably crashed our own banking system.  However, the flip side of this issue is the people have little control over the value and politics surrounding their money, essentially their livelihood!  If you are a savvy investor though, you can take back some of that control.  If you are a savvy crypto investor, you can take back infinitely more.
Crypto currencies are volatile, but they are NOT controlled by any single entity or central government.  They are essentially ‘the people’s money.’  
In today’s political climate, a hedge against governments is a necessity.  If you don’t have somewhere else to park your wealth, you can potentially lose everything you have worked for you entire life if your government isn’t prudent with its actions and faithful to its citizens. 
Blockfi gives anyone with a smart phone quick and easy access to not only a handful of the most popular digital assests but also digital FIAT and inflation hedges like gold.

BlockFi uses robo-advisors(AI) for their lending equipped with an automatic margin call system as a safety mechanism.  It is critical to implement safety nets like this when distributing loans that are calculated on a loan to value ratio (LTV).  
Block Fi also uses strong encryption including modern ciphers, supported protocols and multi factor authentication and real time security software to protect the network and your hard-earned funds!

### **Fintech Trends & Landscape:**

Just like software as a service (SAAS) is all the rage among investors in the stock market today, banking as a service (BAAS) is a popular new trend in the fintech space.  And rightfully so.  If we can shop, work, and socialize from our phones why can’t we bank? Streamlining banking via the IOT allows constant monitoring of access activity from anywhere at any time.   
Design a language, not a product.  The way a platform looks is certainly important. However, what is even more important is how the users are perceiving it.  As a basic rule or marketing tells us, when there is a lack of information, a customer or user is most likely to choose inaction.  Therefore, the more informed or guided a user is, the better their experience will be.  The easier the customer experience, the higher the conversion rate.  Make sure the platform provides the answers that are easily found and guides the user through the desired experience.  It is best to use collaboration of multiple designers to achieve the best possible outcome.

AI is all the rage, and for any industry involving huge amounts of capital, so Is AI based security.  “Artificial intelligence can not only assist in making better business decisions it can also improve the user safety within BaaS digital platforms.  AI technology can monitor and learn user behavior within a digital platform to better recognize and alert users when their accounts have been accessed by bot the user and more importantly hackers.”  - Techfunnel.com  

Similar to AI security, chatbot user service is a quick and effective way to instantly address commonly asked questions as well as expedite live customer service.  On top of that AI based technology is constantly learning, so it’s regularly upgrading and improving its functionality.  This also allows customers to cut costs and maintain efficient customer service.  
Paperless remittances, providing real time payments and access to alternative forms of currency are now essential to remain relevant and keep up with the ever-changing digital landscape.  

Big tech like amazon, apple and Google are trying to make their mark within the space and carve themselves out a place in it. 
Although Blockfi is the oldest and at the time of writing this, they are technically the most over all trustworthy company; there are some exciting competitors in the space as well as some alterative forms of digital lending and staking.  Celsius network allows the deposit as well as lending/staking of many more coins than blockfi some with higher rewards.  Youhodler is another similar app with high APY’s and many available assets.  These are just a few in the space, if you do a quick research, you will find even more options, however the ones names where the best numbers from my personal investigation.

All these apps are considered centralized to a point however, which even though it allows for better protections, it’s not decentralized.  If you want to be fully Defi and off grid you can use platforms like AAVE & MAKER to stake your Ethereum or other assets and borrow real money against them.  Regardless of your credit history.  If you have bad credit by the way, you will have more luck taking out money on a fully decentralized platform like AAVE.

### **Recommendations:**  

BlockFi crushed the competition in funding and continues to crush the competition in revenue.  However Celsius group has an extremely high CEO rating and offers much more attractive returns, rates and has a wide variety of available assets, so Blockfi better keep an eye on the competition.  Of course, competition is a good thing, it keeps everyone honest.  
Full decentralized competitors like AAVE can offer widely higher and more attractive rates for some assets but Defi comes with more risk so buckle your seat best and never invest anything you are wiling to lose.

As a blockfi user I am not divorcing them anytime soon, but I am without a doubt going to deposit some value into Celsius network to see what all the fuss is about.  So I would suggest Blockfi to stop reducing their rates as they have been the last few quarters.   I would also urge them to offer more assets as there is a wide variety of crypto assets they are leaving out, therefore leaving money on the table.  
Limit orders and a more robust trading platform should be added at some point, it can be optional as well as I think the default should be simplified trading in a clear and concise UI without a lot of noise.  That is all great and fine but give the advanced traders the option to messy up their worlds!  A derivates/futures option would be nice as well, however I’m sure there are nasty regulatory hurdles they would have to deal with, as the SEC doesn’t like normal people taking on much risk now, do they?
